A  class  is  thread safe  if  it  behaves  correctly  when  accessed  from  multiple  threads,  regardless  of  the  scheduling  or 
interleaving of the execution of those threads by the runtime environment, and with no additional synchronization or 
other coordination on the part  of the calling code.
